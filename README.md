DEPRECATED
================

This plugin has been deprecated and will no longer work after April 30th, 2018. This plugin previously allowed merchants to accept Bitcoin on your Magento2-powered website with Coinbase legacy merchant tools.

[Coinbase Commerce](https://commerce.coinbase.com) is a new merchant payment processor that allows you to accept multiple cryptocurrencies. A Magento2 plugin for Coinbase Commerce will be released in Q2 2018 using the [Coinbase Commerce API](commerce.coinbase.com/docs/api).
